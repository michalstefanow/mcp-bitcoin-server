# Progress Tracker: Bitcoin Wallet MCP Server

## Project Status: Scaffolding Complete

The initial project scaffolding is complete. The basic structure, dependencies, and dummy tool implementations are in place. The project is ready for core wallet logic implementation.

## Completed Work

### Project Setup
- [x] Created initial repository structure
- [x] Set up project with MIT license
- [x] Established README with basic project description
- [x] Created memory bank for project documentation and context
- [x] Initialized project with `pnpm`
- [x] Installed core dependencies (`fastmcp`, `zod`)
- [x] Installed development dependencies (`typescript`, `@types/node`, `ts-node`)
- [x] Configured `tsconfig.json`
- [x] Configured `package.json` (type: module, scripts: build, start, dev, inspect)
- [x] Created project directory structure (`src`, `tests`)
- [x] Implemented basic MCP server (`src/server/server.ts`)
- [x] Implemented dummy tools (`get_address`, `get_balance`, `send_transaction`)
- [x] Defined basic types (`src/types/index.ts`)
- [x] Created basic configuration (`src/config/index.ts`)
- [x] Created main entry point (`src/index.ts`)
- [x] Added `README.md`

### Documentation
- [x] Defined project brief with core goals and success criteria
- [x] Documented product context and use cases
- [x] Outlined system architecture and patterns
- [x] Specified technical context and potential technologies
- [x] Established active context and next steps
- [x] Updated `activeContext.md` with current status
- [x] Updated `progress.md` (this file)

## In Progress Work

- [ ] Evaluating specific libraries for SPV, P2P, and Keychain access.

## Pending Work

### Core Functionality (Real Implementation)
- [ ] Implement Key Management (generation, encryption, keychain storage/retrieval)
- [ ] Implement Address Generation
- [ ] Implement SPV Client (block headers, peer connection)
- [ ] Implement UTXO Tracking (via SPV)
- [ ] Implement `get_balance` tool logic
- [ ] Implement Transaction Creation & Signing
- [ ] Implement Transaction Broadcasting
- [ ] Implement `send_transaction` tool logic
- [ ] Implement `get_address` tool logic

### Security Implementation
- [ ] Finalize key encryption details
- [ ] Implement robust keychain interaction
- [ ] Add input validation beyond basic schema checks

### Testing
- [ ] Set up testing framework (e.g., Jest)
- [ ] Write unit tests for key management and wallet logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for tool execution
- [ ] Plan for testnet transaction testing

### Documentation
- [ ] Refine `README.md` as features are added
- [ ] Document specific library choices and rationale
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation for tools
- [ ] Create integration guide examples
- [ ] Document security practices in detail

## Known Issues

- Dummy tool implementations return static data.
- No actual Bitcoin wallet functionality exists yet.
- Keychain interaction and SPV logic are not implemented.

## Blockers

No current blockers.

## Notes

- Project is in very early stages with focus on establishing the core architecture
- All functionality is currently in planning phase, not implementation
- Security considerations must be addressed at every step of development
