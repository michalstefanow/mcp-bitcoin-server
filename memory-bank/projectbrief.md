# Project Brief: Bitcoin Wallet MCP Server

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to send and receive Bitcoin payments. The server will provide a secure and standardized interface for AI systems to interact with the Bitcoin network.

## Core Goals
- Create a fully functional MCP server that exposes Bitcoin wallet functionality
- Enable AI agents to create wallets, send transactions, and check balances
- Implement secure handling of private keys and transaction signing
- Provide a robust API that follows MCP standards
- Ensure proper error handling and transaction validation

## Target Users
- AI systems and agents that need to interact with Bitcoin
- Developers building AI applications that require Bitcoin payment capabilities
- Services that want to enable AI-driven financial transactions

## Success Criteria
- AI agents can successfully create Bitcoin wallets
- Transactions can be sent and received through the MCP interface
- Wallet balances can be monitored in real-time
- All operations follow Bitcoin security best practices
- The server is reliable and handles errors gracefully
