// Placeholder for key management
// This module will handle:
// 1. Private key generation on first run
// 2. Key encryption using WALLET_PASSWORD
// 3. Secure storage of encrypted key in OS keychain
// 4. Key retrieval and decryption for signing

/**
 * KeyManager (to be implemented)
 * Will manage a single private key (no HD wallet)
 * Only exposes the decrypted key briefly during signing operations
